## Code Analysis Report

This report identifies potential improvements in the codebase.

### General Recommendations

- **Error Handling:** Replace `console.error` and `process.exit(1)` with throwing errors to allow for more graceful error handling.
- **Database Transactions:** Refactor database transactions to improve readability.
- **Code Duplication:** Identify and eliminate duplicated code by creating shared utility functions.
- **Dynamic SQL:** Avoid building SQL queries dynamically using string concatenation. Consider using a query builder library or a more structured approach.

### Specific Recommendations

#### `src/commands/add.js`

- **Lack of Input Validation:** While there's a check for an empty task description, there isn't comprehensive validation for other inputs like `due`, `urgency`, `tag`, and `hide`. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors if the inputs are in an incorrect format.
- **Urgency Validation:** The code retrieves all valid urgencies from the database every time a task is added. This could be inefficient, especially if the number of urgencies is large. Consider caching the valid urgencies or using a more efficient query.
- **Tag Validation:** The tag validation regex is not very user-friendly. Consider providing a more descriptive error message.
- **Database Transaction:** The database transaction is immediately invoked with `()()`. This might be confusing. Consider refactoring to make it more readable.
- **Error Handling:** The `add` function has a try-catch block, but it simply logs the error and re-throws it. Consider adding more specific error handling or logging.

#### `src/commands/delete.js`

- **Error Handling:** The function uses `console.error` and `process.exit(1)` for error handling. This abruptly terminates the program. Consider throwing an error instead, allowing the caller to handle it more gracefully.
- **SQL Injection:** The `id` is directly interpolated into the SQL query using `LIKE ?`. This is a potential SQL injection vulnerability. Consider using parameterized queries with exact matches instead of `LIKE`. If `LIKE` is necessary, ensure proper sanitization of the input.
- **Partial Matches:** The `LIKE` operator with `%` allows partial matches. This might not be the intended behavior. Consider using an exact match (`=`) instead.
- **Error Message:** The error message "Error: Failed to delete task" is not very informative. Consider providing more details about why the deletion failed.

#### `src/commands/doing.js`

- **Error Handling:** The function uses `console.error` and `process.exit(1)` for error handling. This abruptly terminates the program. Consider throwing an error instead, allowing the caller to handle it more gracefully.
- **SQL Injection:** The `id` is directly interpolated into the SQL query using `LIKE ?`. This is a potential SQL injection vulnerability. Consider using parameterized queries with exact matches instead of `LIKE`.
- **Partial Matches:** The `LIKE` operator with `%` allows partial matches. This might not be the intended behavior. Consider using an exact match (`=`) instead.
- **Error Message:** The error message "Error: Failed to update task" is not very informative. Consider providing more details about why the update failed.

#### `src/commands/done.js`

- **Error Handling:** The function uses `console.error` and `process.exit(1)` for error handling. This abruptly terminates the program. Consider throwing an error instead, allowing the caller to handle it more gracefully.
- **SQL Injection:** The `id` is directly interpolated into the SQL query using `LIKE ?`. This is a potential SQL injection vulnerability. Consider using parameterized queries with exact matches instead of `LIKE`.
- **Partial Matches:** The `LIKE` operator with `%` allows partial matches. This might not be the intended behavior. Consider using an exact match (`=`) instead.
- **Error Message:** The error message "Error: Failed to update task" is not very informative. Consider providing more details about why the update failed.

#### `src/commands/edit.js`

- **Lack of Input Validation:** There isn't comprehensive validation for inputs like `title`, `due`, `urgency`, `tag`, and `hide`. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors if the inputs are in an incorrect format.
- **Urgency Validation:** The code retrieves all valid urgencies from the database every time a task is edited. This could be inefficient, especially if the number of urgencies is large. Consider caching the valid urgencies or using a more efficient query.
- **Dynamic SQL:** The function builds the SQL query dynamically using string concatenation. This can be error-prone and difficult to maintain. Consider using a query builder library or a more structured approach.
- **Database Transaction:** The database transaction is immediately invoked with `()()`. This might be confusing. Consider refactoring to make it more readable.
- **Error Handling:** The `editTask` function has a try-catch block, but it simply logs the error and re-throws it. Consider adding more specific error handling or logging.

#### `src/commands/list.js`

- **SQL Injection:** The `parseFilter` function uses `LIKE ?` with user-provided input in the `title` and `id` filters. This is a potential SQL injection vulnerability. Consider using parameterized queries with exact matches instead of `LIKE`. If `LIKE` is necessary, ensure proper sanitization of the input.
- **Dynamic SQL:** The `buildTaskQuery` function builds the SQL query dynamically using string concatenation. This can be error-prone and difficult to maintain. Consider using a query builder library or a more structured approach.
- **Date Parsing:** The `parseFilter` function calls `parseRelativeDate` directly. Consider centralizing date parsing logic.
- **Filter Parsing:** The `parseFilter` function is complex and could be simplified.
- **String Manipulation:** The `stripParentheses` function in `parseFilter` could be simplified using regex.

#### `src/database/db.js`

- **Database Initialization:** The database schema is defined using `db.exec`. Consider using a migration tool to manage schema changes.
- **String Concatenation:** The `dbPath` is constructed using string concatenation. Consider using `path.resolve` for better cross-platform compatibility.
- **Date Formatting:** The `getCurrentDate` function formats the date manually. Consider using a library like `date-fns` for more robust date formatting.

#### `src/utils/dateUtils.js`

- **Date Parsing:** The `parseRelativeDate` function uses a long series of `if` statements to handle different date formats. Consider using a more structured approach, such as a lookup table or a dedicated date parsing library.
- **Error Handling:** The function returns `null` for invalid date formats. Consider throwing an error instead, allowing the caller to handle it more gracefully.
- **Code Duplication:** The function calls `format(parsedDate, "yyyy-MM-dd")` multiple times. Consider creating a helper function to avoid code duplication.
